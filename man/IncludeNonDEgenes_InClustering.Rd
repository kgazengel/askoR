\usage{
IncludeNonDEgenes_InClustering(data, asko_norm, resDEG, parameters, clustering)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{list contain all data and metadata (DGEList, samples descritions, contrast, design and annotations)}

\item{asko_norm}{large DGEList with normalized counts by GEnorm function.}

\item{resDEG}{data frame contains for each contrast the significance expression (1/0/-1) for all genes coming from DEanalysis function.}

\item{parameters}{list that contains all arguments charged in Asko_start.}

\item{clustering}{data frame with clusters of each gene produced by ClustAndGO function}
}
\value{
none
}
\description{
Add a cluster with the genes that are not DE in the analysis to the ClustAndGO analysis
\itemize{
\item Graphs of clusters (heatmap and boxplot) created through ClustAndGO function with an additionnal cluster repr√©senting NON DE genes
\item Expression profile of NON DE genes
\item GO enrichments on NON DE genes
\item Files with gene description of each significant enriched GO
