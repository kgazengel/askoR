\item{glmfit}{fitted linear model object.}

\item{ASKOlist}{list of data.frame contain condition, contrast and context information made by asko3c.}

\item{context}{coefficient/contrast tested.}
}
\value{
one of this:
\itemize{
\item matrix with mean counts,
\item meanValue for one context/Condition.
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
    # calculate mean counts in contrast contx1_vs_contx2
    mean1<-NormCountsMean(glmfit, ASKOlist, contx1)   # in the 1st context
    mean2<-NormCountsMean(glmfit, ASKOlist, contx2)   # in the 2nd context

    # for all conditions
    n_count<-NormCountsMean(glmfit, ASKOlist, context=NULL)
}
